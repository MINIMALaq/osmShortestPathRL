Find Shortest Path between two points on OSM using Reinforcement Learning.

I want to find shortest path between two points on OSM using Reinforcement Leaarning.

In the first step I will find the Shortest Path using Q-Value Reinforcement Learning on an arbitrary graph.

Then I want to use OSM graph as an input.

Then I will solve the problem usin DQN on OSM.

After that I will solve TSP using DQN in another project.

Finally, I want to propose a model free agent method to solve a more general logistics problem in yet another projec :)
