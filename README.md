# osmShortestPathRL
Find Shortest Path between two points on OSM using Reinforcement Learning.

I want to find shortest path between two points on OSM using Reinforcement Leaarning.
In the first step I will find the Shortest Path using Q-Value Reinforcement Learning on an arbitrary graph.
Then I want to use OSM graph as an input.
Then I will solve the problem usin DQN on OSM.
After that I will solve TSP using DQN in another project.
Finally I want to propose a model free agent method to solve a more general logistics problem in yet another projec :)
